# Hack-a-thon-SVPCET

#Problem Statement:
Many individuals have difficulty keeping track of their medical information, including current
conditions, medications, allergies, and vaccination records. This can lead to confusion and
errors when visiting different healthcare providers, and can also make it difficult for emergency
responders to provide appropriate care in case of an emergency. In addition, accessing this
information can be difficult when away from home or without access to a computer.

Objective:
The objective of this hackathon is to develop a digital health care card that can store and track a
person's medical information, allowing for easy access and updates by authorized medical
professionals. Additionally, the team should create a software for mobile devices and smart
watches that are linked to the card, allowing for easy access to the individual's medical
information on-the-go. The card should also have features such as reminders for appointments
and medication schedules, as well as the ability to alert emergency responders in case of an
emergency. The goal is to create a user-friendly and secure solution that improves the overall
management and coordination of a person's health care, and make it easily accessible in any
situation.
