Architecture
The NFC-based EMR architecture can be seen in Fig. The EMR application on 
the doctor's phone can be used to read and change the EMR content, while the EMR 
application on the patient can only be used for reading. When the patient first comes to 
the doctor and the doctor does not have the patient’s EMR then the doctor needs to copy 
the EMR from the patient’s phone by tap between the patient's phone and the doctor’s 
phone. Upon medical examination of the patient then the doctor will renew the EMR 
and keep it. Patients will get the latest EMR from a doctor using NFC.
This architecture also allows one phone to be used to store multiple EMR from 
different people. Confidentiality is maintained with the use of autotentication in 
developed application
