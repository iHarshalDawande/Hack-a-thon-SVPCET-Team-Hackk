# I. Introduction

A Medical Record is a file containing records and documents about the patient containing identity,
examination, medication, other medical treatment in health care facilities for outpatients,
hospitalized by both government and private. The benefits of medical records include medicinal
purposes, improvement of service quality, education and research, financing, health statistics, as
well as legal, discipline, and ethical proofs. The need for a practical, complete, and accurate medical
record becomes an urgent need in today's healthcare services. The practicality of medical records,
among others, can be seen from the media used in storing medical record data, the process of
updating medical record data, and the process of reading medical records. Medical records are also
required to contain complete information about the patient's medical history. Data on medical
records is used as a reference of medical personnel in dealing with patients therefore this data must
be accurate. Three properties of medical records are difficult to meet by conventional medical
records by using paper as the medium.
Robust healthcare is required in both developed countries, where healthcare costs are high and
security and privacy are critical concerns, and developing countries such as India where despite of
affordable services the quality of service provide provided is low. Science and technology
advancements in the field of healthcare have improved people's lives. Simultaneously, mobile
phones are gradually being used to solve some difficult healthcare issues. The goal of this project,
DIGITAL MEDICAL RECORD USING NFC, is to computerize the front office management of a hospital
in order to develop software that is user friendly, simple, fast, and cost effective by utilizing the
promising features of NFC. Because NFC cards have internal memory, patients can store critical
information on their NFC card for quick access in emergency situations. This information can change
and is customizable. As critical fast access data, information such as blood type and allergies can be
stored. This paper suggests a novel application of NFC-enabled mobile devices to access secure
external medical tags for identifying medical objects such as medicines and patient health cards. The
Health card could be stored on an external tag or on the patient's mobile device via NFC Peer to Peer
(P2P) or card emulation modes. The business logic of using a Health card on mobile devices can be
advantageous to a medical professional because it can securely identify patients using simple
identification methods.
