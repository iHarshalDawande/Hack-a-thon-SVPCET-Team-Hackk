Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication standard which enables two devices in a short range to establish a communication channel within a short period of time through radio waves in the 13.56 MHz frequency range. NFC technology allows off-line data transfer between mobile phones. In addition NFC also has a secure element section that allows it to store data securely. Through special applications the data can be modified by the authorized party using an authentication system. In this hackathon an electronic medical record was developed by our team using NFC.
