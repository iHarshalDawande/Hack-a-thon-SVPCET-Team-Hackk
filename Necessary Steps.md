To implement the NFC-based secure healthcare architecture, you would need to have knowledge of programming languages such as Java, and experience with developing mobile applications and cloud-based systems.

Here's an overview of the steps we will follow to implement the program:

Develop a secure hybrid cloud system: This system would serve as the central repository for patient's EHRs and provide cryptographic servers for a secure framework. You would need to ensure that the cloud system is secure and scalable, and that it can handle the storage and retrieval of large amounts of data.

Develop MobileADMIN, Mobile-P and Mobile-D applications: These applications would be used to access and manage the patient's EHRs. The MobileADMIN application would be used by hospital administration to manage the smartcard-based tags and patient health cards, while the Mobile-P and Mobile-D applications would be used by patients and doctors to access the patient's EHRs.

Implement NFC and Bluetooth interfaces: The SE and simple interfaces of NFC and Bluetooth would be used for credential storage and communication between the devices. You would need to ensure that the communication between the devices is secure and that the data being transferred is protected.

Implement encryption and decryption algorithms: You would need to implement algorithms for encrypting and decrypting the data being transferred between the devices. You could use symmetrical encryption algorithms such as AES to encrypt the data and ensure that only authorized devices can access the patient's EHRs.

Test and deploy the system: Once the development of the program is complete, you would need to thoroughly test the system to ensure that it is working correctly and that it meets the requirements. You would then deploy the system to the hybrid cloud and make it available to the hospitals that subscribe to the Health Secure service.
