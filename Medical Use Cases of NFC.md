# IV. MEDICAL USE CASES OF NFC

There are a lot of use cases for NFC in medical devices and healthcare. The possible areas include
monitoring and management of home based care. The application includes monitoring systems for a
variety of chronic diseases, including but not limited to diabetes, hypertension, cardiac diseases
(infarctions, heart failure, arrhythmias and other rhythm abnormalities), pulmonary diseases like
asthma and COPD, and neurological abnormalities like seizures, chronic renal failure, etc. For
example, a biometric device called ―MiniMEǁ developed by Ergonomidesign monitors various vital
parameters like ECG, blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry, body temperature, blood glucose,
cholesterol, hemoglobin and prothrombin time, and transmits the data using NFC to the cloud.
Another company working on medical devices with NFC embedded in them is Impak Health. They
are involved in home-based cardiac, pulmonary and sleep monitoring. They have incorporated NFC
in devices such as ―RhythmTrackǁ that tracks a person's ECG, and ―SleepTrack,ǁ which tracks the
sleep cycle and duration. Similarly, FITBIT – a fitness monitoring company – has incorporated NFC for
transferring details like calories burned, number of steps taken and other details from a wristband
to the user‘s smartphone which houses a user-friendly application. Gentag, a company specializing
in mobile health, is using NFC to transfer data from devices ranging from diagnostic assays to skin
patches. NFC is becoming widely accepted for medical devices in some markets specifically in the
developed countries. Sony Corporation has developed an NFC Healthcare Library which enables
communication between healthcare products embedded with the NFC Dynamic Tag and healthcare
applications installed on smartphones. This library is available free of charge for a number of OS,
including Windows, Linux and Android. Companies like Omron, Terumo and A&D are incorporating
Sony‘s solution into their devices like BP monitors, pedometers, blood glucose meters, etc. Various
other companies like Qolpac and Identive WPG have brought NFC into the mainstream with uses
ranging from medication compliance to X-ray image sharing.
We plan to make use of this library provided by Sony in our device and enable native access and
reporting of results directly in the form of Near Field Communication.
